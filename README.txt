Json Path Finder:
    I preferred to code in Python because it comes with a very good support to parse json
    and 'dict' saves a lot of boilerplate code (if I had used a json parsing library like gson in Java)
    I organised the code in 2 files.
    path_finder.py has the core logic to parse and resolve path of a json.
    test_path_finder.py imports the path_finder module and tests it against a series of input.
